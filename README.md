My at-home development. 

I prefer Paterson system tanks for color and slide, steel tanks for black and white.

Current preferred developers:
  Black & White:
    Rodinal (ROD)
    Kodak HC-110 (HC110(d)ilution) (still have some bottles of the old formula)
  Color:
    CineStill C41 "color simplified" (CS41)
    CineStill E6 "dynamic chrome" (CS6)

Current scanners: 
  Nikon Coolscan V (135)
  Epson Perfection V800 (all formats)
