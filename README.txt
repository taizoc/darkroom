My at-home development. 

I prefer Paterson system tanks for color and slide roll film processing, steel tanks for black and white.
I have a large Yankee tank for large format and a Combi-Plan. Up until now I've borrowed a friend's Stearman Press 645 tank for color. 

Preferred chemistry:
-BW film developer:
--Rodinal (log code: ROD)
--Kodak HC-110 (HC110(d)ilution)
-BW paper developer:
--Kodak Dektol
-BW film stop:
--Cap full of white vinegar in first rinse
-BW paper stop
--Kodak Indicator Stop Bath
-BW film and paper fixer:
--"Eco-Pro" 
-Color film developer:
--CineStill C41 "color simplified" (CS41)
--CineStill E6 "dynamic chrome" (CS6)

Past film chems:
-Ilfosol 3
-FPP dry ECN-2 kit (do not prefer for inconsistencies in  results)
-Xtol

Current film scanners: 
-Nikon Coolscan V (135)
-Epson Perfection V800 (all formats)
