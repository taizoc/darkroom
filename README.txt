# darkroom
My at-home development. 

I prefer Paterson system tanks for color and slide, steel tanks for black and white.
I have a large Yankee tank for large format and a Combi-Plan that I'm missing a part for at the moment. 

Current preferred developers:
-Black & White:
--Rodinal (code: ROD)
--Kodak HC-110 (HC110(d)ilution) Still have some bottles of the old formula.
-Color:
--CineStill C41 "color simplified" (CS41)
--CineStill E6 "dynamic chrome" (CS6)
Previously used chems:
-Ilfosol 3
-FPP dry ECN-2 kit (do not prefer for inconsistencies in  mixed chemistry)
-Xtol

Current scanners: 
-Nikon Coolscan V (135)
-Epson Perfection V800 (all formats, betterscanning.com ANR inserts for 135 through 4x5
